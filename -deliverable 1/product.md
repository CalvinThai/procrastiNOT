## What are you planning to build?


We are planning to build a Google Chrome extension that is designed to help with time management and procrastination. 

The app lets the user input time slots into a schedule of when they want to focus on a certain task, and provides in-browser notifications when the time period begins. To help the user stay focused, the extension will deny connections to URLs that the user has inputted, as to deny them access to sites such as Facebook, and Reddit, which are common distractions. In addition to this, the app lets the user schedule notifications throughout allocated time period so that when you are supposed to be doing a task, you receive constant reminders to make you remain focused. 

Take the case of a user who has allocated two hours to study for a midterm. They find themselves getting constantly side-tracked by sites that they frequent, such as Reddit. Our application would interrupt the user’s connections to a list of websites that he chooses during that time period, so that whenever he visits Reddit during his study period, the extension will deny the connection and remind the user to continue studying.


## Who are your target users?

Our target users are people who have a problem doing their work. We define two primary user profiles that we are designing our application around:

The first consumer profile is composed of people with attention deficits. Research shows that in the classroom context, providing people with attention deficit disorders a cue, such as a tap on the shoulder, or pointing at them, in order to remind them to pay attention can significantly increase their focus [1]. Our application attempts to provide a ‘cue’ for people with attention deficit disorders, but also for people with minor problems paying attention. The internet can be an easy place to get sidetracked with the constant influx of information thrown your way, so by providing a cue through their web browser, we can help to minimize the distraction from online sources.

The second consumer profile is composed of users that procrastinate on their tasks. The Harvard Business Review wrote a piece on how to combat procrastination and a few points caught our eye [2]. The first is that for procrastinators often times the first step is the hardest, and to combat this, our app will attempt to redirect them to a pre-entered redirection page. For example if a user goes to a site like Reddit (which he has blacklisted) while studying, it will redirect him instead to the CSC301 Course Site (where he has set his redirect link to). The second item described was that often times when you have a partner to whom you’re held accountable, you tend to procrastinate less because of the social pressure such a context applies. Our application can provide social integrations to help people share their schedules (and potentially schedule study sessions with other people) and apply pressure to them to commit to their scheduled time slot.


## Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

Users would want to choose our product because it creates a direct interruption whenever it interferes with their schedule by using one of the channels they subscribe to (using Reddit when you want to be studying).  We’ve identified two popular market solutions to the problem of time management and procrastination and highlight why our application is the superior product to our target user.

When users use a normal scheduler, such as Google Calendar, getting past the reminder is as easy as hitting a button, there is no further reinforcement for their objective to continue working. This will reduce the pressure to focus on their work as they might get distracted and forget about it or ignore it. The features of our application apply pressure on the user to do their work. 

A more direct set of competitors would be StayFocused and Procrastinator, the two biggest Google Chrome extensions under the category of ‘Procrastination’. Both extensions function in much the same way: they block websites for an allocated period of time specified by the user. StayFocused goes as far as blocking certain types of media (images/games/videos), which given enough time and progress is a candidate feature for our own application (and therefore is only a competitive advantage due to scale constraints). However neither of these allow you to plan out your schedule flexibly and ahead of time. In addition both of these apps assume that blacklisting sites is enough to get the user to remain focussed, but we acknowledge that it's possibly that they seek other outlets that distract them. For example a user who frequents Reddit might begin to frequent CNN after one of these apps blacklists Reddit. With our app, in addition to having Reddit blacklisted, the user can opt to have frequent reminders that they are supposed to be working in order to keep them on task.


## Highlights

Our first insight was to solve the problem of procrastination. With the team showing interest in that topic, we started brainstorming potential solutions to solve the problem of procrastination. One idea that we came up with is an application where the user could block access to certain applications. However, we decided that the ideal by itself is too simple and that we needed more features. After not being able to come up with a solid idea to solve procrastination, we looked at other big problems we can solve. We thought of many ideas such as debt payment planner, improved blackboard, timetable planner. However, we soon realized that for these ideas, we are mostly dealing with CRUD operations and as a result we did not go with any of these ideas. Then we thought of some more advanced ideas such as grammar checker and essay/cover letter writing helper. But in the end, we decided that these ideas are too multidisciplinary and it is going to make our jobs a lot harder. Finally, we decided to take our old idea of a timetable planner and combine it with our original procrastination idea which results in our current idea of a scheduler/reminder application. This option that we decided on makes the most sense for our product because we have a general idea of how we want it to function and we have also left enough room in our idea so that if we have any additional features to be added or implemented, we are able to do it. Furthermore, we decided to go with this idea because it deals with a problem that is relatable to all members of the team. As a result, every member of our team can have a cognizant input on features that we can implement or add onto our idea in order to further solve the problem of procrastination and time management.
