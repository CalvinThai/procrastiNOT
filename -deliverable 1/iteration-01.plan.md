Team-26 
Team Name: ProcrastiNOT

#### Iteration 1

Start date: Wednesday, October 11
End date: Friday, October 13

## Process

Our process starts by brainstorming problems and selecting a problem. We then want to start highlighting what some of the key causes are and see if we can provide a software solution for it. From there, we want to begin to articulate our idea by finishing up the first deliverable over Google Docs.

## Roles & responsibilities

Interface Developer (Variable)
Functional Developer (Variable)
Scrum Master (1)
Repo Man (1)

Interface Developers design and implement the visuals for the application. This can range from animating pop ups for notifications, to creating the web page for blacklisted websites.

Functional Developers add functionality to the visuals of the interface developers, by writing code under the hood that persists all the user’s schedule data, trigger certain UI events, and so on.

The Scrum Master will facilitate the entire development team in making sure the team is on schedule by arranging meetings where possible to share progress, and helping create the task specifications for a given sprint.

The Repo Man helps ensure quality control of the code by reviewing commits submitted to the repository and ensuring that they are abiding by agreed upon principles, and doing a correct job of their code.



## Events
For iteration 1, we are planning to have two scheduled meetings outside of tutorials. Our first meeting isa scheduled to be on Wednesday, October 11 at 9pm on Discord. During the meeting we will discuss the ideas that we brainstormed during the tutorial and finalize our product. We will then talk about the questions that we have to answer about our product and start planning for the first deliverable. Afterwards, we will start a Google Doc where we will write up what is required for the first deliverable. We are using Google Docs as a tool because it allows for real-time collaboration between all of our members. Furthermore, each member of our team can easily help correct small mistakes such as grammar and spelling. The goal is to collectively work on the Google Doc and complete a rough draft of what is required for the first deliverable. Our second meeting is scheduled to be on Friday. October 13 at 6pm on Discord. The purpose of this meeting is to revise the rough draft of the first deliverable that we completed last meeting and produce a final copy that we are planning to hand in. We plan on working collectively again on Google Docs and designate one person to copy our final work into the .md files and commit it into our team’s Github repo.

## Artifacts for the Team


We’re planning on using GitHub Projects to organize our team. Within GitHub Projects we plan on having five columns: feature list, todo, work in progress, needs review, and approved. This provides us with a centralized area to keep track of our progress for each iteration. 

All of our product features will be in the feature list. For each mini-sprint we do, the features we want to work on are moved to the todo list. The task is also converted to an issue and tagged with its priority level (low-medium-high), as well as the team that will be working on it. Below is an example image of a GitHub Projects entry. Once a team has begun working on an issue it is moved to the WIP section, and once done they move it to the needs review section. Once in the needs review section ONLY the repo man can move it to the completed section, after he has reviewed it.

## Product

Goals and tasks

Our goals for this iteration were to come up with the product plan and a plan for how we wanted to collaborate, as well as wrapping up the deliverables. 

Our tasks for this iteration were as follows:

- Product idea brainstorm
- Vote on product idea
- Articulating our product description, target users and rationale behind people choosing our product through product.md.
- Figure out how we would like to collaborate as a team through plan.md.
- Discuss artifacts that would help in presenting our idea.
- Finish review.md (Go over everything we did in this iteration)
## Artifacts for the Product

We will use images that highlight how our application interrupts the browser with notifications and what a blocked site will look like when it is attempted to be accessed because it provides a frame of reference for our discussion about “mental cues” for procrastination and attention problems.

We will also use a static webpage as an interactive artifact to be able to make our presentation more engaging so that the value of our presentation is not lost on bored professors and TAs.

We may add more later as issues come up or if something needs to be documented.
