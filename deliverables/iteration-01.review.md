## Iteration 01	 - Review & Retrospect


When: October 13th, 2017
Where: Online

#### Decisions that turned out well

1. Coming up with and agreeing on the idea to build a web-based app to help students who procrastinate. This decision allowed our group to focus on a particular problem and brainstorm ways on how to build our project to solve it.
2. Deciding to use ‘Discord’ as a means of communication. This decision allows our group to collaborate using both voice and text chat, and also provides an additional way to hold team meetings other than in person.
3. Compiling our first deliverable into a single google doc turned out to be successful. It made the process of writing and choosing sections that needed to be filled out quicker and more efficient. Using Google Docs, we were able to all work on an updated version simultaneously. We could also make comments on certain parts of them, which let our ideas evolve over time as we reviewed them. You can see below an example of how we developed our procedure.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

1. The process of coming up with a solid idea/problem our group wanted to tackle for this project was not as successful. Our group created a text-channel strictly for ideas in which team members can share what came to mind. However, not many ideas were passed into the channel.
2. Trying to plan a weekly meeting time period to work meet up and work. This is because everyone’s schedule changes from week to week, especially in the midst of midterm season. Instead of this, we would have to dynamically plan a meeting time at the start of each week.

#### Planned changes

1. We plan to have more offline meetings in later iterations as there is only so much we can report on our progress and collaborate online
2. We decided to have more frequent online meetings, that is, allocating a specific time period where everyone will be online and able to communicate in real time in order to resolve current issues and conflicts. Frequent online meetings are much more viable than offline ones, as the only requirement to attend the meeting is having access to a computer during your free time, whereas offline meetings requires scheduling and potential traveling.
3. As there are not very many concrete roles aside from developers available for the scope of this project, we intend to alternate people as the scrum master and repo man. That way, two individual will not have to put in more work than others but at the same time, everyone is able to gain experience in the different roles.

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

1. We came up with a real world problem to solve
2. We came up with and voted on a product idea that can help users solve that problem
3. We have agreed on that we would communicate as a team through Discord
4. We have finalized on that we would use images and static web pages as artifacts that would help in presenting our idea
5. We articulated our product description, target users and rationale people people choosing our product
6. We completed everything that was required for the first deliverable

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

1. Although our team has discussed a general concept of how we want our web extension to look and function, we have not yet completed the artifacts to demonstrate these features. 

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:
1. Assigning roles for each team member in coding the program
2. Creation of a product mockup or wireframe
