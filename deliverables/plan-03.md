## Iteration 3

 * Start date: Nov. 18, 2017
 * End date: Nov. 29, 2017

## Process

#### Changes from previous iteration

List the most significant changes you made to your process (if any).

We did not make many significant changes to our process, however a significant process decision our team made was:
	* Making sure that we hold a meeting with everybody in it at least once a week. We consider this successful because it allows the entire team to get up to date on what everyone is doing and makes it easy to decide on what to do next. Although we had weekly meetings for deliverable 1, we didn’t have them for deliverable 2, which made it hard to accomplish relevant work.


#### Roles & responsibilities

Hilal and Nick: Scheduler Module
Zelin and Calvin: Front-End/Interface
Simon and David: Blocklist Module

Those responsible for a backend feature will have to implement it, as well as make adjustments to the front-end interface for their specific parts.
Front-end developers will be responsible for the rest of the user interface and overall structure and design of the extension.

#### Events

* We are planning to have other meetings online to try to update the group on what everyone has done and what we will try to do next. The purpose of this type of meeting is to get everyone on the same page and deliberate the next steps.
* We can also have other unplanned events when we ask about adding parts to each other’s code since they are all integrated. The purpose of this is to ensure that everything works together and to avoid stepping on each other’s toes.

#### Artifacts

* Github Issues page to post problems
* Github Project to organize our Issues
* Discord group to keep up with communication and conduct frequent online meetings
* Frequent meetings to distribute the tasks and reevaluate

#### Git / GitHub workflow


Our Git workflow consists of a few simple repeatable steps.
1. After being assigned specific tasks for the week (an iteration), you and whoever is working together with you for that feature or interface will discuss with one another how to go forward with it.
2. The small teams of 2 may further split up what parts of their feature they will code or simply work on-and-off on the same codebase, that is, one person could be sleeping or working on other assignments while their partner continues on their part. As their knowledge of their specific feature is shared, they will not have a hard time picking off after each other. The small teams frequently commits their parts after every coding session.
3. Occasionally, the entire team will discuss how to integrate each other’s parts together. During this step, most of our team will be communicating live as to resolve conflicts and bugs across our features.
4. At the end of the iteration, we have a meeting and review our code and progress and perform some more integration to arrive at a more presentable product.

By working in small teams of 2 and splitting up the feature implementations, we are able to avoid stepping on each other’s code as much as possible. Having a partner also gives each individual more accountability as well as a second opinion when coming up with more functionality for their feature. By splitting their work down, it is not necessary for both partners to be constantly working at the same time, allowing for more flexibility and rest. Frequent deliberations on integrating all of the features helps us get a better sense of the direction of our product and remaining tasks.



## Product

#### Goals and tasks

The goals for this iteration are:
* A finished product ready to be demo’d.
* Have scheduled sessions properly reflect on the calendar.
* Working modes creation feature that allows users to specify what mode a blocked url should be placed under. This allows users the freedom to have certain blocked url redirect them to an appropriate site, completely block the site or give them a daily time limit to use it for brief leisure.
* Integration with some sort of outside source calendar system like Google Calendar or simply .ics files.
Tasks we will have to complete in order to achieve these:
	* Integrate calendar functionality alongside the session scheduling.
	* Replace placeholder html in the modes creation page with functioning code.
	* Create alternative ways to handle a url that is on our blocklist.
	* Properly apply the user-specified method of handling that url using some sort of mapping of url to handling method.


#### Artifacts

Deliverable 3 Demo Video
This is a required artifact for this deliverable and will serve the purpose of introducing our target audience and the common problem they may face and the solution that our product will provide to them. The video will demonstrate features of our product that we have implemented up to date as well as potential steps will take going forward in the next iteration. This video will ideally demonstrate our final complete product.
