## Iteration 4 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Friday, November 17, 2017
 * Where: Online

#### Decisions that turned out well

Using the Github issues worked well because we can easily see the problems people post and talk about what changes we make or ask questions about the specific issue
Use of Discord groups worked well because it let us communicate in real time or leave messages about anything we do in the project
Having teams of 2 per section helped out because it let each group to have some support for bugs without interfering with the other members’ work




#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

- Roles were defined but not well followed
A result of bad communication throughout the deliverable caused a buildup of work nearing the end. Because of this, there were a lot of things to do, and people worked on anything that was available, instead of on the tasks pertaining to their roles.

- Many failed attempts at forming a meeting with everybody present
This was mainly due to scheduling issues for each of the members. During this time, many members had other priorities that they needed to be there for and for many cases, we were unable to hold a meeting with everybody present.



#### Planned changes

- Hard deadlines for features
Throughout development for this deliverable, issues were created, but no one was held accountable for them. As a result of this, some issues were never worked on, or weren’t worked on until the deadline neared.
- Better communication throughout the development period
We didn’t have many structured meetings throughout the development period, rather we communicated mostly through text, and many times one or more members wouldn’t be present during the discussions, so there was a lot of confusion with what other members were working on. To combat this issue, we’ll have more structured meetings so the group can work as a whole, rather than small teams.

Product has basic functionality



#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

Implementation of the modes in our extension
Brainstorming of more features



## Meeting Highlights

We want to try to integrate a Google calendar into our extension. We want it to be more accessible to plan the active sessions to the users and to easily see when the planned sessions are.
We also want to implement the modes within the next iteration. This was a goal that was planned, but never met for this part, so we would like to implement it to try to follow our goals.
