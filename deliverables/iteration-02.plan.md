## Iteration 2

 * Start date: Friday, November 3, 2017
 * End date: Saturday, November 4, 2017

## Process


Our process began with us meeting online on November 3 and delegating roles and tasks to be completed for the upcoming iteration.

#### Roles & responsibilities

Hilal and Nick: Scheduler Module
Zelin and Calvin: Front-End/Interface
Simon and David: Blocklist Module

Those responsible for a backend feature will have to implement it, as well as making adjustments to the front-end interface for their specific parts.
Front-end developers will be responsible for the rest of the user interface and overall structure and design of the extension.

#### Events


We are planning to have other meetings online to try to update the group on what everyone has done and what we will try to do next. We can also have other unplanned events when we ask about adding parts to each other’s code since they are all integrated.




#### Artifacts

Github Issues page to post problems
Github Project to organize our Issues
Discord group to keep up with communication and conduct frequent online meetings
Frequent meetings to distribute the tasks and reevaluate



Our Git workflow consists of a few simple repeatable steps.
1. After being assigned specific tasks for the week (an iteration), you and whoever is working together with you for that feature or interface will discuss with one another how to go forward with it.
2. The small teams of 2 may further split up what parts of their feature they will code or simply work on-and-off on the same codebase, that is, one person could be sleeping or working on other assignments while their partner continues on their part. As their knowledge of their specific feature is shared, they will not have a hard time picking off after each other. The small teams frequently commits their parts after every coding session.
3. Occasionally, the entire team will discuss how to integrate each other’s parts together. During this step, most of our team will be communicating live as to resolve conflicts and bugs across our features.
4. At the end of the iteration, we have a meeting and review our code and progress and perform some more integration to arrive at a more presentable product.
Working on small teams of 2 and splitting up the feature implementations, we are able to avoid stepping on each other’s code as much as possible. Having a partner also gives each individual more accountability as well as a second opinion when coming up with more functionality for their feature. By splitting their work down, it is not necessary for both partners to be constantly working at the same time, allowing for more flexibility and rest. Frequent deliberations on integrating all of the features helps us get a better sense of the direction of our product and remaining tasks.

## Product

#### Goals and tasks

A highly presentable product. This entails the entirety of the front-end and large portions of the back-end to be made in order to complement it in adding functionalities and features of our final desired product.
Decide on the framework for our extension
Have a coded base for each of our respective parts ready
Each team works on what their parts should at least contain for the minimum viable product
Our primary feature of blocking user-specified pages and scheduling sessions as to when to block them should be fully implemented. The front-end hosting these features in our extension must be intuitive and easy to use for everyday users.
A calendar to provide visual feedback to the user when they add sessions to our extension. Also serves as an easy method of reorganizing their sessions by dragging and dropping them around.
Potentially, a way to sync up with their user’s Google Calendar.

#### Artifacts

Extension Wireframe
The wireframe will provide a visual concept and help the group not only understand how our extension will look, but most importantly, function. We intend to create views to present the ideas we generate for each feature and clarify how we want each feature to be implemented. 

Deliverable 2 Demo Video
This is a required artifact for this deliverable and will serve the purpose of introducing our target audience and the common problem they may face and the solution that our product will provide to them. The video will demonstrate features of our product that we have implemented up to date as well as potential steps will take going forward in the next iteration.
