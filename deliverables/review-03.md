## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Nov. 29, 2017
 * Where: Online

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well


* Using the Github issues worked well because we can easily see the problems people post and talk about what changes we make or ask questions about the specific issue
* Use of Discord groups worked well because it let us communicate in real time or leave messages about anything we do in the project
* Having teams of 2 per section helped out because it let each group to have some support for bugs without interfering with the other members’ work

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped


* Roles were defined but not well followed (again). A result of bad communication throughout the deliverable caused a buildup of work nearing the end. Because of this, there were a lot of things to do, and people worked on anything that was available, instead of on the tasks pertaining to their roles.
* Many failed attempts at forming a meeting with everybody present (again). This was mainly due to scheduling issues for each of the members. During this time, many members had other priorities that they needed to be there for and for many cases, we were unable to hold a meeting with everybody present.


#### Planned changes

Now that we near the end of the semester, there aren’t really any process-related changes we are planning to make. Any that we would attempt to make would be too late by now.

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

* Sessions integration alongside the extension calendar has been successfully implemented. They are now reflected on calendar and saved in the cache.
* Modes section allows for users to select urls to be mapped to user-specified modes where they will be active during user-specified sessions with that mode.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

* Finished product for final demo. While all of our primary features have been implemented, we believe there are still a ton of little details we could add or fix before achieving an application that is ideal for the demo.
* Integration with outside calendar source. We had experimented with integrating Google Calendar into our project but only one person was able to make use of it on their end. It ended up needlessly complicating our development and so we decided to scrap it for our MVP.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

* Making the application look a little nicer on the front-end. Throughout our project, we didn’t place too much emphasis on our design. We could look into making it more intuitive for end-users. We could look into a theme for our overall front-end.
* Reorganizing our code base. As we move through crunch time phases, we started to prioritise functionality over modularity and as such our code base in some parts looks like a mess and could be cleaned up.
