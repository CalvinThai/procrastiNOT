## NPM Usage Reminders

--

After you clone the repository you want to type

npm install

This will install all the modules that people might have installed as the application will be dependent on them and it won't run without them.

--

The node_modules directory is in our git_ignore so any file you place in there will not be tracked by Git.


## Testing

You can run the test suit by running

npm test
